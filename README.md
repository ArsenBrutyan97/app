## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone 

    ```

2. Do install

    npm install

3. Before running the project, create a .env file in your project based on my example.env; otherwise, you may encounter errors

4. Run project

    npm run start
